          <li><h3> Bambi </h3></li>
            <p>Bambi is a lovely dog. All she ever wants is cuddles and to be on your lap
              to watch gilmore girls. Her favotite shows include but are not limited to:
              friends, gilmore girls, the office and Tedbundy. A future serial killer. DO NOT touch her face.

          <li> <h3>Cookie</h3> </li>
          <p> Cookie is a hyper loving dog. But be aware, if you look for commitment she is not the dog. If there is a rubber
            ball in the same hous.. neighborhood. She WILL prioritise the ball over you. If she is hungry she will flash you widt
            her ugly teeths forcing you to give her pizza.
